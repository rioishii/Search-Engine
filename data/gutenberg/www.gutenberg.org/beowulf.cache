measures the venerable epic beowulf approximately i repeat for a very close reproduction of anglosaxon verse would to a large extent be prose to a modern ear the heynesocin text and glossary have been closely followed occasionally a deviation has been made but always for what seemed good and sufficient reason the translator does not aim to be an editor once in a while however he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students of the poem this work is addressed to two classes of readers from both of these alike the translator begs sympathy and cooperation the anglosaxon scholar he hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original the student of english literature he aims to interest by giving him in modern garb the most ancient epic of our race this is a bold and venturesome undertaking and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow even a daring guide if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of hrothgar of the prowess of beowulf and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes in order to please the larger class of readers a regular cadence has been used a measure which while retaining the essential characteristics of the original permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading perhaps every anglosaxon scholar has his own theory as to how beowulf should be translated some have given us prose versions of what we believe to be a great poem is it any reflection on our honored kemble and arnold to say that their translations fail to show a layman that beowulf is justly called our first epic of those translators who have used verse several have written viii from what would seem a mistaken point of view is it proper for instance that the grave and solemn speeches of beowulf and hrothgar be put in ballad measures tripping lightly and airily along or again is it fitting that the rough martial music of anglosaxon verse be interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse do we hear what has been beautifully called “the clanging tread of a warrior in mail” of all english translations of beowulf that of professor garnett alone gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great teutonic epic the measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a reproduction of the original as modern english affords the cadences closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking poems the four stresses of the anglosaxon verse are retained and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular cadence alliteration has been used to a large extent but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line endrhyme has been used occasionally internal rhyme sporadically both have some warrant in anglosaxon poetry for endrhyme see 1 53 1 54 for internal rhyme 2 21 6 40 what gummere1 calls the “rimegiver” has been studiously kept viz the first accented syllable in the second halfverse always carries the alliteration and the last accented syllable alliterates only sporadically alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the original see 7 61 8 5 no two accented syllables have been brought together except occasionally after a cæsural pause see 2 19 and 12 1 or scientifically speaking sievers’s c type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of translation several of his types however constantly occur eg a and a variant  x  x  x x  x b and a variant x  x   x x  x   a variant of d  x  x x e  x x   anacrusis gives further variety to the types used in the translation the parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved eg 1 16 and 1 17 “lord” and “wielder of glory” 1 30 1 31 1 32 2 12 and 2 13 2 27 and 2 28 3 5 and 3 6 occasionally some loss has been sustained but on the other hand a gain has here and there been made the effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the translation all words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have been ix avoided again though many archaic words have been used there are none it is believed which are not found in standard modern poetry with these preliminary remarks it will not be amiss to give an outline of the story of the poem the story hrothgar king of the danes or scyldings builds a great meadhall or palace in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents the joy of king and retainers is however of short duration grendel the monster is seized with hateful jealousy he cannot brook the sounds of joyance that reach him down in his fendwelling near the hall oft and anon he goes to the joyous building bent on direful mischief thane after thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured while no one is found strong enough and bold enough to cope with the monster for twelve years he persecutes hrothgar and his vassals over sea a day’s voyage off beowulf of the geats nephew of higelac king of the geats hears of grendel’s doings and of hrothgar’s misery he resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king with fourteen chosen companions he sets sail for daneland reaching that country he soon persuades hrothgar of his ability to help him the hours that elapse before night are spent in beerdrinking and conversation when hrothgar’s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of beowulf telling him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace all retire to rest beowulf as it were sleeping upon his arms grendel comes the great marchstepper bearing god’s anger he seizes and kills one of the sleeping warriors then he advances towards beowulf a fierce and desperate handtohand struggle ensues no arms are used both combatants trusting to strength and handgrip beowulf tears grendel’s shoulder from its socket and the monster retreats to his den howling and yelling with agony and fury the wound is fatal the next morning at early dawn warriors in numbers flock to the hall heorot to hear the news joy is boundless glee runs high hrothgar and his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts grendel’s mother however comes the next night to avenge his death she is furious and raging while beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart x from the quarters of the other warriors she seizes one of hrothgar’s favorite counsellors and carries him off and devours him beowulf is called determined to leave heorot entirely purified he arms himself and goes down to look for the female monster after traveling through the waters many hours he meets her near the seabottom she drags him to her den there he sees grendel lying dead after a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the woman he slays her and swims upward in triumph taking with him grendel’s head joy is renewed at heorot congratulations crowd upon the victor hrothgar literally pours treasures into the lap of beowulf and it is agreed among the vassals of the king that beowulf will be their next liegelord beowulf leaves daneland hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure when the hero arrives in his own land higelac treats him as a distinguished guest he is the hero of the hour beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people the geats after he has been ruling for fifty years his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a firespewing dragon beowulf determines to kill him in the ensuing struggle both beowulf and the dragon are slain the grief of the geats is inexpressible they determine however to leave nothing undone to honor the memory of their lord a great funeralpyre is built and his body is burnt then a memorialbarrow is made visible from a great distance that sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national hero of geatland the poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery his gentleness his goodness of heart and his generosity it is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the story of beowulf shall be as familiar to englishspeaking peoples as that of the iliad beowulf is our first great epic it is an epitomized history of the life of the teutonic races it brings vividly before us our forefathers of prealfredian eras in their love of war of sea and of adventure my special thanks are due to professors francis a march and james a harrison for

3 a very difficult passage ‘áhte’ 31 has no object h supplies ‘geweald’ from the context and our translation is based upon this assumption though it is far from satisfactory kl suggests ‘lændagas’ for ‘lange’ and the beloved landprince enjoyed had his transitory days ie lived b suggests a dislocation but this is a dangerous doctrine pushed rather far by that eminent scholar 4 the reading of the hso text has been quite closely followed but some eminent scholars read ‘sélerædenne’ for ‘selerædende’ if that be adopted the passage will read men cannot tell us indeed the order of fate etc ‘selerædende’ has two things to support it 1 v 1347 2 it affords a parallel to ‘men’ in v 50 ii scyld’s successors—hrothgar’s great meadhall beowulf succeeds his father scyld in the boroughs then beowulf bairn of the scyldings belovèd landprince for longlasting season was famed mid the folk his father departed the prince from his dwelling till afterward sprang 5 greatminded healfdene the danes

battle to hrothgar was given waxing of warfame that willingly kinsmen obeyed his bidding till the boys grew to manhood 15 a numerous band it burned in his spirit to urge his folk to found a great building a meadhall grander than men of the era he is eager to build a great hall in which he may feast his retainers ever had heard of and in it to share with young and old all of the blessings 20 the lord had allowed him save life and retainers then the work i find afar was assigned 4 to many races in middleearth’s regions to adorn the great folkhall in due time it happened early ’mong men

swordwrath arise for a woman’s husband and father then the mighty warspirit1 endured for a season the monster grendel is madly envious of the danemen’s joy bore it bitterly he who bided in darkness 35 that lighthearted laughter loud in the building greeted him daily there was dulcet harpmusic clear song of the singer he said that was able the course of the story is interrupted by a short reference to some old account of the creation to tell from of old earthmen’s beginnings that father almighty earth had created 40 the winsome wold that the water encircleth set exultingly the sun’s and the moon’s beams to lavish their lustre on landfolk and races and earth he embellished in all her regions with limbs and leaves life he bestowed too 45 on all the kindreds that live under heaven the glee of the warriors is overcast by a horrible dread so blessed with abundance brimming with joyance the warriors abided till a certain one gan to dog them with deeds of direfullest malice a foe in the hallbuilding this horrible stranger2 50 was grendel entitled the marchstepper famous who3 dwelt in the moorfens the marsh and the fastness the wanmooded being abode for a season 5 in the land of the giants when the lord and creator had banned him and branded for that bitter murder 55 the killing of abel allruling father cain is referred to as a progenitor of grendel and of monsters in general the kindred of cain crushed with his vengeance in the feud he rejoiced not but far away drove him from kindred and kind that crime to atone for meter of justice thence illfavored creatures 60 elves and giants monsters of ocean came into being and the giants that longtime grappled with god he gave them requital 1 r and t b prefer ‘ellorgæst’ to ‘ellengæst’ 86 then the stranger from afar endured etc

grendel the murderer grendel attacks the sleeping heroes when the sun was sunken he set out to visit the lofty hallbuilding how the ringdanes had used it for beds and benches when the banquet was over then he found there reposing many a noble 5 asleep after supper sorrow the heroes1 misery knew not the monster of evil greedy and cruel tarried but little he drags off thirty of them and devours them fell and frantic and forced from their slumbers thirty of thanemen thence he departed 10 leaping and laughing his lair to return to with surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward in the dusk of the dawning as the day was just breaking was grendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors a cry of agony goes up when grendel’s horrible deed is fully realized then his mealtaking finished a moan was uplifted 15 morningcry mighty the manruler famous the longworthy atheling sat very woful suffered great sorrow sighed for his liegemen 6 when they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer the spirit accursèd too crushing that sorrow the monster returns the next night 20 too loathsome and lasting not longer he tarried but one night after continued his slaughter shameless and shocking shrinking but little from malice and murder they mastered him fully he was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for 25 a pleasanter place of repose in the lodges a bed in the bowers then was brought to his notice told him truly by token apparent the hallthane’s hatred he held himself after further and faster who the foeman did baffle 30 2so ruled he and strongly strove against justice lone against all men till empty uptowered king hrothgar’s agony and suspense last twelve years the choicest of houses long was the season twelvewinters’ time torture suffered the friend of the scyldings every affliction 35 endless agony hence it after3 became certainly known to the children of men sadly in measures that long against hrothgar grendel struggled—his grudges he cherished murderous malice many a winter 40 strife unremitting and peacefully wished he 4lifewoe to lift from no liegeman at all of the men of the danefolk for money to settle no counsellor needed count for a moment 7 on handsome amends at the hands of the murderer grendel is unremitting in his persecutions 45 the monster of evil fiercely did harass the illplanning deathshade both elder and younger trapping and tricking them he trod every night then the mistcovered moorfens men do not know where witches and wizards wander and ramble 50 so the foe of mankind many of evils grievous injuries often accomplished horrible hermit heort he frequented gembedecked palace when nightshades had fallen god is against the monster since god did oppose him not the throne could he touch5 55 the lightflashing jewel love of him knew not ’twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the scyldings the king and his council deliberate in vain soulcrushing sorrow not seldom in private sat the king in his council conference held they what the braves should determine ’gainst terrors unlooked for they invoke the aid of their gods 60 at the shrines of their idols often they promised gifts and offerings earnestly prayed they the devil from hell would help them to lighten their people’s oppression such practice they used then hope of the heathen hell they remembered 65 in innermost spirit god they knew not the true god they do not know judge of their actions allwielding ruler no praise could they give the guardian of heaven the wielder of glory woe will be his who through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to 70 the clutch of the fire no comfort shall look for wax no wiser well for the man who living his lifedays his lord may face and find defence in his father’s embrace 1 the translation is based on ‘weras’ adopted by hso—k and th read ‘wera’ and arranging differently render 1192120 they knew not sorrow the wretchedness of man aught of misfortune—for ‘unhælo’ 120 r suggests ‘unfælo’ the uncanny creature greedy and

scyldings suffered distress every woe great sorrows etc 3 for ‘syððan’ b suggests ‘sárcwidum’ hence in mournful words it became well known etc various other words beginning with ‘s’ have been conjectured 4 the hso glossary is very inconsistent in referring to this passage—‘sibbe’ 154 which hso regards as an instr b takes as accus obj of ‘wolde’ putting a comma after deniga he renders he did not desire peace with any of the danes nor did he wish to remove their lifewoe nor to settle for money 5 of this difficult passage the following interpretations among others are given 1 though grendel has frequented heorot as a demon he could not become ruler of the danes on account of his hostility to god 2 hrothgar was much grieved that grendel had not appeared before his throne to receive presents 3 he was not permitted to devastate the hall on account of the creator ie god wished to make his visit fatal to him—ne … wisse 169 w renders nor had he any desire to do so ‘his’ being obj gen danach 8 iv beowulf goes to hrothgar’s assistance hrothgar sees no way of escape from the persecutions of grendel so healfdene’s kinsman constantly mused on his longlasting sorrow the battlethane clever was not anywise able evils to ’scape from too crushing the sorrow that came to the people 5 loathsome and lasting the lifegrinding torture beowulf the geat hero of the poem hears of hrothgar’s sorrow and resolves to go to his assistance greatest of nightwoes so higelac’s liegeman good amid geatmen of grendel’s achievements heard in his home1 of heroes then living he was stoutest and strongest sturdy and noble 10 he bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty he said he the warking would seek o’er the ocean the folkleader noble since he needed retainers for the perilous project prudent companions chided him little though loving him dearly 15 they egged the brave atheling augured him glory with fourteen carefully chosen companions he sets out for daneland the excellent knight from the folk of the geatmen had liegemen selected likest to prove them trustworthy warriors with fourteen companions the vessel he looked for a liegeman then showed them 20 a seacrafty man the bounds of the country fast the days fleeted the float was awater the craft by the cliff clomb to the prow then wellequipped warriors the wavecurrents twisted the sea on the sand

foamynecked floater fanned by the breeze likest a bird glided the waters in twenty four hours they reach the shores of hrothgar’s dominions 30 till twenty and four hours thereafter the twiststemmed vessel had traveled such distance that the sailingmen saw the sloping embankments the sea cliffs gleaming precipitous mountains nesses enormous they were nearing the limits 35 at the end of the ocean2 up thence quickly the men of the weders clomb to the mainland fastened their vessel battle weeds rattled war burnies clattered the wielder they thanked that the ways o’er the waters had waxen so gentle they are hailed by the danish coast guard 40 then well from the cliff edge the guard of the scyldings who the seacliffs should see to saw o’er the gangway brave ones bearing beauteous targets armor all ready anxiously thought he musing and wondering what men were approaching 45 high on his horse then hrothgar’s retainer turned him to coastward mightily brandished his lance in his hands questioned with boldness his challenge “who are ye men here mailcovered warriors clad in your corslets come thus adriving 50 a high riding ship o’er the shoals of the waters 3and hither ’neath helmets

treacherous spies to the land of the scyldings 65 and farther fare i fully must know now what race ye belong to ye faraway dwellers seafaring sailors my simple opinion hear ye and hearken haste is most fitting plainly to tell me what place ye are come from” 1 ‘from hám’ 194 is much disputed one rendering is beowulf being away from home heard of hrothgar’s troubles etc another that adopted by s and endorsed in the hso notes is b heard from his neighborhood neighbors ie in his home etc a third is b being at home heard this as occurring away from home the hso glossary and notes conflict 2 ‘eoletes’ 224 is marked with a by hso our rendering simply follows his conjecture—other conjectures as to ‘eolet’ are 1 voyage 2 toil labor 3 hasty journey 3 the lacuna of the ms at this point has been supplied by various conjectures the reading adopted by hso has been rendered in the above translation w like hso makes ‘ic’ the beginning of a new sentence but for ‘helmas bæron’ he reads ‘hringed stefnan’ this has the advantage of giving a parallel to ‘brontne ceol’ instead of a kenning for ‘go’—b puts the after ‘holmas’ and begins a new sentence at the middle of the line translate what warriors are ye clad in armor who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the water way hither over the seas for some time on the wall i have been coast guard etc s endorses most of what b says but leaves out ‘on the wall’ in the last sentence if w’s ‘hringed stefnan’ be accepted change line 51 above to a ringstemmed vessel hither o’ersea 4 ‘seldguma’ 249 is variously rendered 1

they easily thither might fare on their journey the aforementioned warrior turning his courser quoth as he left them the coastguard having discharged his duty bids them godspeed “’tis time i were

their battlesarks rattled the gear of the heroes 10 the lances stood up then all in a cluster the arms of the seamen ashenshafts mounted with edges of iron the armorclad troopers a danish hero asks them whence and why they are come were decked with weapons then a proudmooded hero asked of the champions questions of lineage 15 “from what borders bear ye your battleshields plated gilded and gleaming your graycolored burnies helmets with visors and heap of warlances— to hrothgar the king i am servant and liegeman ’mong folk from farlands found i have never he expresses no little

hrothgar and beowulf hrothgar remembers beowulf as a youth and also remembers his father hrothgar answered helm of the scyldings “i remember this man as the merest of striplings his father long dead

with many a liegeman an excellent thanegroup some there did await them and as bid of the brave one the battlegear guarded 30 together they hied them while the hero did guide them ’neath heorot’s roof the highminded went then sturdy ’neath helmet till he stood in the building beowulf spake his burnie did glisten his armor seamed over by the art of the craftsman beowulf salutes hrothgar and then proceeds to boast of his youthful achievements 35 “hail thou hrothgar i am higelac’s kinsman and vassal forsooth many a wonder i dared as a stripling the doings of grendel in faroff fatherland i fully

timid—understanding ‘unforhte’ as an adj has this advantage viz that it gives a parallel to ‘geátena leóde’ but to take it as an adv is more natural furthermore to call the geats ‘brave’ might at this point seem like an implied thrust at the danes so long helpless while to call his own men ‘timid’ would be befouling his own nest 5 for ‘headwatch’ cf hso notes and cf v 2910—th translates thou wilt

expected assistance the people’s protector the old king trusts beowulf the heroes are joyful heard from beowulf his bold resolution there was laughter of heroes loud was the clatter 55 the words were winsome wealhtheow advanced then queen wealhtheow plays the hostess consort of hrothgar of courtesy mindful golddecked saluted the men in the building and the freeborn woman the beaker presented she offers the cup to her husband first to the lord of the kingdom first of the eastdanes 60 bade him be blithesome when beer was aflowing lief to his liegemen he lustily tasted of banquet and beaker battlefamed ruler the helmingish lady then graciously circled ’mid all the liegemen lesser and greater 23 she gives presents to the heroes 65 treasurecups tendered till time was afforded that the decorousmooded diademed folkqueen then she offers the cup to beowulf thanking god that aid has come might bear to beowulf the bumper o’errunning she greeted the geatprince god she did thank most wise in her words that her wish was accomplished 70 that in any of earlmen she ever should look for solace in sorrow he accepted the beaker battlebold warrior at wealhtheow’s giving beowulf states to the queen the object of his visit then equipped for combat quoth he in measures beowulf spake offspring of ecgtheow 75 “i purposed in spirit when i mounted the ocean i determined to do or die when i boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen i would work to the fullest the will of your people or in foe’sclutches fastened fall in the battle deeds i shall do of daring and prowess 80 or the last of

high then again as of yore was heard in the building 85 courtly discussion conquerors’ shouting heroes were happy till healfdene’s son would go to his slumber to seek for refreshing for the horrid hellmonster in the hallbuilding knew he a fight was determined2 since the light of the sun they 90 no longer could see and lowering darkness o’er all had descended and dark under heaven shadowy shapes came shying around them hrothgar retires leaving beowulf in charge of the hall the liegemen all rose then one saluted the other hrothgar beowulf in rhythmical measures 95 wishing him well and the wassailhall giving to his care and keeping quoth he departing 24 “not to any one else have i ever entrusted but thee and thee only the hall of the danemen since high i could heave my hand and my buckler 100 take thou in charge now the noblest of houses be mindful of honor exhibiting prowess watch ’gainst the foeman thou shalt want no enjoyments survive thou safely adventure so glorious” 1 the repetition of ‘hwæðere’ 574 and 578 is regarded by some scholars as a defect b suggests ‘swá þær’ for the first so there it befell me etc another suggestion is to change the second ‘hwæðere’ into ‘swá þær’ so there i escaped with my life etc 2 kl suggests a period after ‘determined’ this would give the passage as follows since they no longer could see the light of the sun and lowering darkness was down over all dire under the heavens shadowy beings came going around them xi all sleep save one hrothgar retires then hrothgar departed his earlthrong attending him folklord of scyldings forth from

heard recounted for the king of the danemen he did special service gave the giant a watcher and the prince of the geatmen implicitly trusted beowulf is selfconfident his warlike strength and the wielder’s protection he prepares for rest 10 his armor of iron off him he did then his helmet from his head to his henchman committed his chasedhandled chainsword choicest of weapons and bade him bide with his battleequipments the good one then uttered words of defiance 15 beowulf geatman ere his bed he upmounted beowulf boasts of his ability to cope with grendel “i hold me no meaner in matters of prowess in warlike achievements than grendel does himself hence i seek not with swordedge to sooth him to slumber of life to bereave him though well i am able we will fight with nature’s weapons only 20 no battleskill1 has he that blows he should strike me to shatter my shield though sure he is mighty 25 in strife and destruction but struggling by night we shall do without edges dare he to look for weaponless warfare and wisemooded father 25 the glory apportion god everholy god may decide who shall conquer on which hand soever to him seemeth proper” then the bravemooded hero bent to his

terror to foemen he angrily bided the issue of battle2 1 gr understood ‘gódra’ as meaning ‘advantages in battle’ this rendering hso rejects the latter takes the passage as meaning that grendel though mighty and formidable has no skill in the art of war 2 b in his masterly articles on beowulf p and b xii rejects the division usually made at this point ‘þá’ 711 usually rendered ‘then’ he translates ‘when’ and connects its clause with the foregoing sentence these changes he makes to reduce the number of ‘cóm’s’ as principal verbs cf 703 711 721 with all deference to this acute scholar i must say that it seems to me that the poet is exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on which the whole subsequent action turns first he grendel came in the wan night second he came from the moor third he came to the hall time place from which place to which are all given 26 xii grendel and beowulf grendel comes from the fens ’neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then grendel going god’s anger bare he the monster intended some one of earthmen in the hallbuilding grand to entrap and make way with he goes towards the joyous building 5 he went under welkin where well he knew of the winejoyous building brilliant with plating goldhall of earthmen not the earliest occasion this was not his first visit there he the home and manor of hrothgar had sought ne’er found he in lifedays later nor earlier 10 hardier hero hallthanes1 more sturdy then came to the building the warrior marching his horrid fingers tear the door open bereft of his joyance the door quickly opened on firehinges fastened when his fingers had touched it the fell one had flung then—his fury so bitter— 15 open the entrance early thereafter the foeman trod the shining hallpavement he strides furiously into the hall strode he angrily from the eyes of him glimmered a lustre unlovely likest to fire he beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers 20 a circle of kinsmen sleeping together he exults over his supposed prey a throng of thanemen then his thoughts were exultant he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen the life from his body horrible demon ere morning came since fate had allowed him fate has decreed that he shall devour no more heroes beowulf suffers from suspense 25 the prospect of plenty providence willed not to permit him any more of men under heaven to eat in the nighttime higelac’s kinsman great sorrow endured how the diremooded creature 27 in unlookedfor assaults were likely to bear him 30 no thought had the monster of deferring the matter grendel immediately seizes a sleeping warrior and devours him but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of a soldier asleep suddenly tore him bit his boneprison the blood drank in currents swallowed in mouthfuls he soon had the dead man’s 35 feet and hands too eaten entirely nearer he strode then the stouthearted warrior beowulf and grendel grapple snatched as he slumbered seizing with handgrip forward the foeman foined with his hand caught he quickly the cunning deviser 40 on his elbow he rested this early discovered the master of malice that in middleearth’s regions ’neath the whole of the heavens no handgrapple greater the monster is amazed at beowulf’s strength in any man else had he ever encountered fearful in spirit faintmooded waxed he 45 not off could betake him death he was pondering he is anxious to flee would fly to his covert seek the devils’ assembly his calling no more was the same he had followed long in his lifetime the liegekinsman worthy beowulf recalls his boast of the evening and determines to fulfil it of higelac minded his speech of the evening 50 stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him his fingers crackled the giant was outward the earl stepped farther the famous one minded to flee away farther if he found an occasion and off and away avoiding delay 55 to fly to the fenmoors he fully was ware of the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman ’twas a luckless day for grendel ’twas an illtaken journey that the injurybringing harrying harmer to heorot wandered the hall groans the palace reechoed to all of the danemen 60

bonedecked resplendent crush it by cunning unless clutch of the fire in smoke should consume it the sound mounted upward grendel’s cries terrify the danes 75 novel enough on the north danes fastened a terror of anguish on all of the men there who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven heard him hymns of horror howl and his sorrow 80 hellbound bewailing he held him too firmly who was strongest of mainstrength of men of that era 1 b and tb emend so as to make lines 9 and 10 read never in his life earlier or later had he the hellthane found a braver hero—they argue that beowulf’s companions had done nothing to merit such encomiums as the usual readings allow them 2 for ‘réðe rénweardas’ 771 tb suggests ‘réðe rénhearde’ translate they were both angry raging and mighty xiii grendel is vanquished beowulf has no idea of letting grendel live for no cause whatever would the earlmen’s defender leave in lifejoys the loathsome newcomer he deemed his existence utterly useless to men under heaven many a noble 5 of beowulf brandished his battlesword old would guard the life of his lord and protector the farfamous chieftain if able to do so while waging the warfare this wist they but little brave battlethanes while his body intending no weapon would harm grendel he bore a charmed life 10 to slit into slivers and seeking his spirit that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons of all on the earth nor any of warbills 29 was willing to injure but weapons of victory swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with 15 his death at that time must prove to be wretched and the faraway spirit widely should journey into enemies’ power this plainly he saw then who with mirth1 of mood malice no little had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen 20 to god he was hostile that his body would fail him but higelac’s hardy henchman and kinsman held him by the hand hateful to other grendel is sorely wounded was each one if living a bodywound suffered the direful demon damage incurable his body bursts 25 was seen on his shoulder his sinews were shivered his body did burst to beowulf was given glory in battle grendel from thenceward must flee and hide him in the fencliffs and marshes sick unto death his dwelling must look for 30 unwinsome and woful he wist the more fully the monster flees away to hide in the moors the end of his earthly existence was nearing his lifedays’ limits at last for the danemen when the slaughter was over their wish was accomplished the comerfromfarland had cleansed then of evil 35 wise and

burdensome balesorrows fully 40 the craftbegot evil they erstwhile had suffered and were forced to endure from crushing oppression their manifold misery ’twas a manifest token beowulf suspends grendel’s hand and arm in heorot when the heroinbattle the hand suspended the arm and the shoulder there was all of the claw 45 of grendel together ’neath greatstretching hallroof 1 it has been proposed to translate ‘myrðe’ by with sorrow but there seems no authority for such a rendering to the present translator the phrase ‘módes myrðe’ seems a mere padding for gladly ie he who gladly harassed mankind 30 xiv rejoicing of the danes at early dawn warriors from far and near come together to hear of the night’s adventures in the mist of the morning many a warrior stood round the gifthall as the story is told me folkprinces fared then from far and from near through longstretching journeys to look at the wonder 5 the footprints of the foeman few of the warriors few warriors lamented grendel’s destruction who gazed on the foottracks of the inglorious creature his parting from life pained very deeply how weary in spirit off from those regions in combats conquered he carried his traces 10 fated and flying to the flood of the nickers grendel’s blood dyes the waters there in bloody billows bubbled the currents the angry eddy was everywhere mingled and seething with gore welling with swordblood1 he deathdoomed had hid him when reaved of his joyance 15 he laid down his life in the lair he had fled to his heathenish spirit where hell did receive him thence the friends from of old backward turned them and many a younker from merry adventure striding their stallions stout from the seaward 20 heroes on horses there were heard very often beowulf is the hero of

numerous host of the race of the scathers they had slain with the swordedge to sigmund accrued then no little of glory when his lifedays were over since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon 50 the hoardtreasure’s keeper ’neath the hoargrayish stone he the son of the atheling unaided adventured the perilous project not present was fitela yet the fortune befell him of forcing his

was a burden to his people oppressed him too long to his people he became then to all the athelings an evergreat burden 70 and the daring one’s journey in days of yore many wise men were wont to deplore such as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow that the son of their ruler should rise into power holding the headship held by his fathers 75 should govern the people the goldhoard and borough the kingdom of heroes the realm of the scyldings beowulf is an honor to his race he to all men became then far more beloved higelac’s kinsman to kindreds and races to his friends much dearer him malice assaulted— the story is resumed 80 oft running and racing on roadsters they measured the duncolored highways then the light of the morning was hurried and hastened went henchmen in numbers

went he he stood by the pillar1 saw the steeprising hallroof gleaming with goldgems and grendel his hand there hrothgar gives thanks for the overthrow of the monster “for the sight we behold now thanks to the wielder 5 early be offered much evil i bided snaring from grendel2 god can e’er ’complish wonder on wonder wielder of glory i had given up all hope when this brave liegeman came to our

accomplished which erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom if his mother yet liveth well may she thank god for this son failed to perform may affirm very truly what woman soever in all of the nations gave birth to the child if yet she surviveth 20 that the longruling lord was lavish to herward in the birth of the bairn now beowulf dear hereafter beowulf thou shalt be my son most excellent hero i’ll love thee in spirit as bairn of my body bear well henceforward the relationship new no lack shall befall thee 25 of earthjoys any i ever can give thee full often for lesser service i’ve

forever and ever the allruler quite thee with good from his hand as he hitherto did thee” beowulf replies i was most happy to render thee this service beowulf answered ecgtheow’s offspring “that labor of glory most gladly achieved we the combat accomplished unquailing we ventured 35 the enemy’s grapple i would grant it much rather thou wert able to look at the creature in person faint unto falling the foe in his trappings on murderbed quickly i minded to bind him with firmholding fetters that forced by my grapple 40 low he should lie in lifeanddeath struggle ’less his body escape i was wholly unable i could not keep the monster from escaping as god did not will that i should since god did not will it to keep him from going not held him that firmly hated opposer too swift was the foeman yet safety regarding 45 he suffered his hand behind him to linger his arm and shoulder to act as watcher he left his hand and arm behind no shadow of solace the woebegone creature found him there nathless the hated destroyer liveth no longer lashed for his evils 50 but sorrow hath seized him in snaremeshes hath him close in its clutches keepeth him writhing in baleful bonds there banished for evil the man shall wait for the mighty tribunal god will give him his deserts how the god of glory shall give him his earnings” 55 then the soldier kept silent son of old ecglaf unferth has nothing more to say for beowulf’s actions speak louder than words from boasting and bragging of battleachievements since the princes beheld there the hand that depended ’neath the lofty halltimbers by the might of the nobleman each one before him the enemy’s fingers 60 each fingernail strong steel most resembled the heathen one’s handspur the heroinbattle’s claw most uncanny quoth they agreeing 35 no sword will

1599 and ‘hafað þæs geworden’ 2027—in a paper published some years ago in one of the johns hopkins university circulars i tried to throw upon these two longdoubtful passages some light derived from a study of like passages in alfred’s prose—the impersonal verb ‘geweorðan’ with an accus of the person and a þætclause is used several times with the meaning ‘agree’ see orosius sweet’s ed 1787 20434 20828 21015 28020 in the two beowulf passages the þætclause is anticipated by ‘þæs’ which is clearly a gen of the thing agreed on the first passage v 1599 b1600 i translate literally then many agreed upon this namely that the seawolf had killed him the second passage v 2025 b2027 she is promised … to this the friend of the scyldings has agreed etc by emending ‘is’ instead of ‘wæs’ 2025 the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony in v 1997 ff this same idiom occurs and was noticed in b’s great article on beowulf which appeared about the time i published my reading of 1599 and 2027 translate 1997 then wouldst let the southdanes themselves decide about their struggle with grendel here ‘súðdene’ is accus of person and ‘gúðe’ is gen of thing agreed on with such collateral support as that afforded by b p and b xii 97 i have no hesitation in departing from hso my usual guide the idiom above treated runs through as old saxon and other teutonic languages and should be noticed in the lexicons 2 ‘bródenmæl’ is regarded by most scholars as meaning a damaskeened sword translate the damaskeened sword burned up cf 25 16 and note 3 ‘cyningbalde’ 1635 is the muchdisputed reading of k and th to render this “nobly bold” “excellently bold” have been suggested b would read ‘cyningholde’ cf 290 and render men welldisposed towards the king carried the head etc ‘cynebealde’ says tb endorsing

keeping of the best of the worldkings where waters encircle 35 who the scot divided in scylding dominion hrothgar looks closely at the old sword hrothgar discoursed the hilt he regarded the ancient heirloom where an oldtime contention’s beginning was graven the gurgling currents the flood slew thereafter the race of the giants 40 they had proved themselves daring that people was loth to it had belonged to a race hateful to god the lord everlasting through lash of the billows the father gave them final requital so in letters of rune on the clasp of the handle gleaming and golden ’twas graven

then again as before were the famousforprowess hallinhabiters handsomely banqueted feasted anew the nightveil fell then 45 dark o’er the warriors the courtiers rose then the grayhaired was anxious to go to his slumbers the hoary old scylding hankered the geatman beowulf is fagged and seeks rest the champion doughty greatly to rest him an earlman early outward did lead him 50 fagged from his faring from farcountry springing who for etiquette’s sake all of a liegeman’s needs regarded such as seamen at that time were bounden to feel the bighearted rested the building uptowered spacious and gilded 55 the guest within slumbered till the sableclad raven blithely foreboded the beacon of heaven then the brightshining sun o’er the bottoms came going2 the warriors hastened the heads of the peoples

stands in hso unferth presents beowulf with the sword hrunting and b thanks him for the gift if however the suggestions of grdtvg and m be accepted the passage will read then the brave one ie beowulf commanded that hrunting be borne to the son of ecglaf unferth bade him take his sword his dear weapon he b thanked him u for the loan etc xxvii sorrow at parting beowulf’s farewell beowulf spake ecgtheow’s offspring “we men of the water wish to declare now fared from farlands we’re firmly determined to seek king higelac here have we fitly 5 been welcomed and feasted as heart would desire it good was the greeting if greater affection i am anywise able ever on earth to gain at thy hands ruler of heroes than yet i have done i shall quickly be ready i shall be ever ready to aid thee 10 for combat and conflict o’er the course of the waters learn i that neighbors alarm thee with terror as haters did whilom i hither will bring thee for help unto heroes henchmen by thousands my liegelord will encourage me in aiding thee i know as to higelac the lord of the geatmen 15 though young in years he yet will permit me by words and by works ward of the people fully to furnish thee forces and

in abundance faraway countries he were better to seek for who trusts in himself” hrothgar discoursed then making rejoinder “these words thou hast uttered 25 allknowing god hath given thy spirit o beowulf thou art wise beyond thy years ne’er heard i an earlman thus early in life more clever in speaking thou’rt cautious of spirit mighty of muscle in mouthanswers prudent i count on the hope that happen it ever 30 that missile shall rob thee of hrethel’s descendant edgehorrid battle and illness or weapon deprive thee of prince of people’s protector should higelac die the geats could find no better successor than thou wouldst make and life thou yet holdest the seageats will never find a more fitting folklord to choose them 35 gemward of heroes than thou mightest prove thee if the kingdom

that many shall visit others o’er the ocean with excellent giftgems 45 the ringadorned bark shall bring o’er the currents presents and lovegifts this people i know tow’rd foeman and friend firmly established1 after ancient etiquette everywise blameless” then the warden of earlmen gave him still farther parting gifts 50 kinsman of healfdene a dozen of jewels bade him safely seek with the presents his wellbeloved people early returning 64 hrothgar kisses beowulf and weeps then the nobleborn king kissed the distinguished dearlovèd liegeman the daneprince saluted him 55 and claspèd his neck tears from him fell from the grayheaded man he two things expected agèd and reverend but rather the second 2that bold in council they’d meet thereafter the man was so dear that he failed to suppress the 60 emotions that moved him but in moodfetters fastened the old king is deeply grieved to part with his benefactor the longfamous hero longeth in secret deep in his spirit for the dearbeloved man though not a bloodkinsman beowulf thenceward goldsplendid warrior walked o’er the meadows 65 exulting in treasure the seagoing vessel riding at anchor awaited its owner as they pressed on their way then the present of hrothgar giving liberally is the true proof of kingship was frequently referred to a folkking indeed that everyway blameless till age did debar him 70 the joys of his

emend so as to negative the verb ‘meet’ “why should hrothgar weep if he expects to meet beowulf again” both these scholars ask but the weeping is mentioned before the ‘expectations’ the tears may have been due to many emotions especially gratitude struggling for expression xxviii the homeward journey—the two queens then the band of very valiant retainers came to the current they were clad all in

brightarmored warriors were going to their vessel welcome etc cf 1804 2 r suggests ‘gewát him on naca’ and renders the vessel set out to drive on the sea the danecountry left ‘on’ bears the alliteration cf ‘on hafu’ 2524 this has some advantages over the hso reading viz 1 it adds nothing to the text 2 it makes ‘naca’ the subject and thus brings the passage into keeping with the context where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the actions of the vessel—b’s emendation cf p and b xii 97 is violent 3 b translates who for a long time ready at the coast had looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men this changes the syntax of ‘léofra manna’ 4 for ‘wunað’ v 1924 several eminent critics suggest ‘wunade’ remained this makes the passage much clearer 5 why should such a woman be described as an ‘excellent’ queen c suggests ‘frécnu’ dangerous bold 6 for ‘an dæges’ various readings have been offered if ‘andéges’ be accepted the sentence will read no hero … dared

being so strong as to interrupt the simile the punctuation of the fourth edition would be better—a comma after ‘galgan’ 2447 the translation may be indicated as follows just as it is sad for an old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when he himself is uttering mournful measures a sorrowful song while his son hangs for a comfort to the raven and he old and infirm cannot render him any

the heap of hoardgems to yield my life and the landfolk whom long i have governed” 1 b renders he w did not regard his the dragon’s head since beowulf had struck it without effect but struck the dragon a little lower down—one crux is to find out whose head is meant another is to bring out the antithesis between ‘head’ and ‘hand’ 2 ‘þæt þæt fýr’ 2702 s emends to ‘þá þæt fýr’ when the fire began to grow less intense afterward this emendation relieves the passage of a plethora of conjunctive þæt’s 3 for ‘gefyldan’ 2707 s proposes ‘gefylde’ the passage would read he felled the foe life drove out strength and they then both had destroyed him chieftains related this gives beowulf the credit of having felled the dragon then they combine to annihilate him—for ‘ellen’ 2707 kl suggests ‘eallne’—the reading ‘life drove out strength’ is very unsatisfactory and very peculiar i would suggest as follows adopt s’s emendation remove h’s parenthesis read ‘ferhellen wræc’ and translate he felled the foe drove out his lifestrength that is made him hors de combat and then they both etc xxxviii wiglaf plunders the dragon’s den—beowulf’s death wiglaf fulfils his lord’s behest then heard i that wihstan’s son very quickly these words being uttered heeded his liegelord wounded and warsick went in his armor his wellwoven ringmail ’neath the roof of the barrow 5 then the trusty retainer treasuregems many the dragon’s den victorious saw when the seat he came near to goldtreasure sparkling spread on the bottom wonder on the wall and the wormcreature’s cavern the ancient dawnflier’s vessels astanding 10 cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavèd robbed of their ornaments there were helmets in numbers old and rusteaten armbracelets many artfully woven wealth can easily gold on the seabottom turn into vanity1 15 each one of earthmen arm him who pleaseth and he saw there lying an allgolden banner high o’er the hoard of handwonders greatest linkèd with lacets a light from it sparkled that the floor of the cavern he was able to look on the dragon is not there 20 to examine the jewels sight of the dragon 94 not any was offered but edge offcarried him wiglaf bears the hoard away then i heard that the hero the hoardtreasure plundered the giantwork ancient reaved in the cavern bare on his bosom the beakers and platters 25 as himself would fain have it and took off the standard the brightest of beacons2 the bill had erst injured its edge was of iron the oldruler’s weapon him who long had watched as ward of the jewels who fireterror carried hot for the treasure 30 rolling in battle in middlemost darkness till murdered he perished the messenger hastened not loth to return hurried by jewels curiosity urged him if excellentmooded alive he should find the lord of the weders 35 mortally wounded at the place where he left him ’mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain his liegelord belovèd at his life’send gory he thereupon ’gan to lave him with water till the point of his word piercèd his breasthoard 40 beowulf spake the goldgems he noticed beowulf is rejoiced to see the jewels the old one in sorrow “for the jewels i look on thanks do i utter for all to the ruler wielder of worship with words of devotion the lord everlasting that he let me such treasures 45 gain for my people ere death overtook me since i’ve bartered the agèd life to me granted for treasure of jewels attend ye henceforward he desires to be held in memory by his people the wants of the warthanes i can wait here no longer the battlefamed bid ye to build them a gravehill 50 bright when i’m burned at the brimcurrent’s limit as a memorymark to the men i have governed 95 aloft it shall tower on whale’sness uprising that earls of the ocean hereafter may call it beowulf’s barrow those who barks everdashing 55 from a distance shall drive o’er the darkness of waters” the hero’s last gift the boldmooded trooplord took from his neck then the ring that was golden gave to his liegeman the youthful warhero his goldflashing helmet his collar and warmail bade him well to enjoy them and last words 60 “thou art latest left of the line of our kindred of wægmunding people weird hath offcarried all of my kinsmen to the creator’s glory earls in their vigor i shall after them fare” ’twas the aged liegelord’s lastspoken word in 65 his musings of spirit ere he mounted the fire the battlewaves burning from his bosom departed his soul to seek the sainted ones’ glory 1 the word ‘oferhígian’ 2767 being vague and little understood two quite distinct translations of this passage have arisen one takes ‘oferhígian’ as meaning ‘to exceed’ and inserting ‘hord’ after ‘gehwone’ renders the treasure may easily the gold in the ground exceed in value every hoard of man hide it who will the other takes ‘oferhígian’ as meaning ‘to render arrogant’ and giving the sentence a moralizing tone renders substantially as in the body of this work cf 28 13 et seq 2 the passage beginning here is very much disputed ‘the bill of the old lord’ is by some regarded as beowulf’s sword by others as that of the ancient possessor of the hoard ‘ær gescód’ 2778 translated in this work as verb and adverb is by some regarded as a compound participial adj sheathed in brass xxxix the dead foes—wiglaf’s bitter taunts wiglaf is sorely grieved to see his lord look so unwarlike it had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer to behold on earth the most ardentbelovèd at his lifedays’ limit lying there helpless the slayer too lay there of life all bereavèd 5 horrible earthdrake harassed with sorrow the dragon has plundered his last hoard the roundtwisted monster was permitted no longer to govern the ringhoards but edges of warswords mightily seized him battlesharp sturdy leavings of hammers that still from his wounds 10 the flierfromfarland fell to the earth hard by his hoardhouse hopped he at midnight not e’er through the air nor exulting in jewels suffered them to see him but he sank then to earthward through the herochief’s handwork i heard sure it throve then 96 few warriors dared to face the monster 15 but few in the land of liegemen of valor though of every achievement bold he had proved him to run ’gainst the breath of the venomous scather or the hall of the treasure to trouble with handblows if he watching had found the ward of the hoardhall 20 on the barrow abiding beowulf’s part of the treasure of jewels was paid for with death each of the twain had attained to the end of life so unlasting not long was the time till the cowardly thanes come out of the thicket the tardyatbattle returned from the thicket 25 the timid trucebreakers ten all together who durst not before play with the lances in the prince of the people’s pressing emergency they are ashamed of their desertion but blushing with shame with shields they betook them with arms and armor where the old one was lying 30 they gazed upon wiglaf he was sitting exhausted footgoing fighter not far from the shoulders of the lord of the people would rouse him with water no whit did it help him though he hoped for it keenly he was able on earth not at all in the leader 35 life to retain and nowise to alter the will of the wielder the worldruler’s power1 would govern the actions of each one of heroes wiglaf is ready to excoriate them as yet he is doing from the young one forthwith then could grimworded greeting be got for him quickly 40 whose courage had failed him wiglaf discoursed then weohstan his son sadmooded hero he begins to taunt them looked on the hated “he who soothness will utter can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels the ornamentarmor wherein ye are standing 45 when on alebench often he offered to hallmen helmet and burnie the prince to his liegemen as best upon earth he was able to find him— 97 surely our lord wasted his armor on poltroons that he wildly wasted his wargear undoubtedly when battle o’ertook him2 the troopking no need

give him in battle and i ’gan notwithstanding with some aid i could have saved our liegelord 55 helping my kinsman my strength overtaxing he waxed the weaker when with weapon i smote on my mortal

suggests ‘déað árædan’ and renders the might or judgment of god would determine death for every man as he still does 2 some critics h himself in earlier editions put the clause ‘when … him’ as ‘þá … beget’ with the following sentence that is they make it dependent upon ‘þorfte’ 2875 instead of upon ‘forwurpe’ 2873 xl the messenger of death wiglaf sends the news of beowulf’s death to liegemen near by then he charged that the battle be announced at the hedge up o’er the cliffedge where the earltroopers bided the whole of the morning moodwretched sat them bearers of battleshields both things expecting 5 the end of his lifetime and the coming again of the liegelord belovèd little reserved he of news that was known who the nesscliff did travel but he truly discoursed to all that could hear him 98 the messenger speaks “now the freegiving friendlord of the folk of the weders 10 the folkprince of geatmen is fast in his deathbed by the deeds of the dragon in deathbed abideth along with him lieth his lifetaking foeman slain with knifewounds he was wholly unable to injure at all the illplanning monster wiglaf sits by our dead lord 15 with bite of his swordedge wiglaf is sitting offspring

folk now expecteth 20 a season of strife when the death of the folkking to frankmen and frisians in farlands is published the warhatred waxed warm ’gainst the hugmen higelac’s death recalled when higelac came with an army of vessels faring to friesland where the frankmen in battle 25 humbled him and bravely with overmight ’complished that the mailclad warrior must sink in the battle fell ’mid his folktroop no fretgems presented the atheling to earlmen aye was denied us merewing’s mercy the men of the swedelands 30 for truce or for truth trust i but little but widely ’twas known that near ravenswood ongentheow hæthcyn’s fall referred to sundered hæthcyn the hrethling from lifejoys when for pride overweening the warscylfings first did seek the geatmen with savage intentions 35 early did

higelac’s bugle and trumpetsound heard they when the good one proceeded 50 and faring followed the flower of the troopers 1 ‘higeméðum’ 2910 is glossed by h as dat plu for the dead s proposes ‘higeméðe’ nom sing limiting wigláf ie w moodweary holds headwatch o’er friend and foe—b suggests taking the word as dat inst plu of an abstract noun in ‘u’ the translation would be substantially the same as s’s xli the messenger’s retrospect the messenger continues and refers to the feuds of swedes and geats “the bloodstainèd trace of swedes and geatmen the deathrush of warmen widely was noticed how the folks with each other feud did awaken the worthy one went then1 with wellbeloved comrades 5 old and dejected to go to the fastness ongentheo earl upward then turned him of higelac’s battle he’d heard on inquiry the exultant one’s prowess despaired of resistance with earls of the ocean to be able to struggle 10 ’gainst seagoing sailors to save the hoardtreasure his wife and his children he fled after thenceward old ’neath the earthwall then was offered pursuance to the braves of the swedemen the banner2 to higelac 100 they fared then forth o’er the fieldofprotection 15 when the hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them then with edges of irons was ongentheow driven the grayhaired to tarry that the troopruler had to suffer the power solely of eofor wulf wounds ongentheow wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him 20 wonred his son that for swinge of the edges the blood from his body burst out in currents forth ’neath his hair he feared not however grayheaded scylfing but speedily quited ongentheow gives a stout blow in return the wasting woundstroke with worse exchange 25 when the king of the thanetroop thither did turn him the wisemooded son of wonred was powerless to give a returnblow to the agehoary man but his headshielding helmet first hewed he to pieces that flecked with gore perforce he did totter 30 fell to the earth not fey was he yet then but up did he spring though an edgewound had reached him eofor smites ongentheow fiercely then higelac’s vassal valiant and dauntless when his brother lay dead made his broadbladed weapon giantsword ancient defence of the giants 35 bound o’er the shieldwall the folkprince succumbed then ongentheow is slain shepherd of people was pierced to the vitals there were many attendants who bound up his kinsman carried him quickly when occasion was granted that the place of the slain they were suffered to manage 40 this pending one hero plundered the other his armor of iron from ongentheow ravished his hardsword hilted and helmet together eofor takes the old king’s wargear to higelac the old one’s equipments he carried to higelac he the jewels received and rewards ’mid the troopers 45 graciously promised and so did accomplish the king of the weders requited the warrush hrethel’s descendant when home he repaired him higelac rewards the brothers to eofor and wulf with widelavished treasures to each of them granted a hundred of thousands 101 50 in land and rings wrought out of wire his gifts were beyond cavil none upon midearth needed to twit him3 with the gifts he gave them when glory they conquered to eofor he also gives his only daughter in marriage and to eofor then gave he his one only daughter the honor of home as an earnest of favor 55 that’s the feud and hatred—as ween i ’twill happen— the anger of earthmen that earls of the swedemen will visit on us when they hear that our leader lifeless is lying he who longtime protected his hoard and kingdom ’gainst hating assailers 60 who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore the deedmighty scyldings4 did for the troopers what best did avail them and further moreover it is time for us to pay the last marks of respect to our lord herodeeds ’complished now is haste most fitting that the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder 65 and that one carry on journey to deathpyre who ringpresents gave us not aught of it all shall melt with the brave one—there’s a mass of bright jewels gold beyond measure grewsomely purchased and ending it all ornamentrings too 70 bought with his life these fire shall devour flame shall cover no earlman shall wear a jewelmemento nor beautiful virgin have on her neck rings to adorn her but wretched in spirit bereavèd of goldgems 75 she shall oft with others be exiled and banished since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken 102 mirth and merriment hence many a warspear cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers heaved in the hand no harpmusic’s sound shall 80 waken the warriors but the wancoated raven fain over fey ones freely shall gabble shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating when the wolf his companion he plundered the slain” so the highminded hero was rehearsing these stories 85 loathsome to hear he lied as to few of the warriors go sadly to look at beowulf’s lifeless body weirds and of words all the wartroop arose then ’neath the eagle’s cape sadly betook them weeping and woful the wonder to look at they saw on the sand then soulless alying 90 his slaughterbed holding him who rings had given them in days that were done then the deathbringing moment was come to the good one that the king very warlike wielder of weders with wonderdeath perished first they beheld there a creature more wondrous they also see the dragon 95 the worm on the field in front of them lying the foeman before them the firespewing dragon ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors was scorched in the fire as he lay there he measured fifty of feet came forth in the nighttime5 100 to rejoice in the air thereafter departing to visit his den he in death was then fastened he would joy in no other earthhollowed caverns there stood round about him beakers and vessels dishes were lying and dearvalued weapons 105 with ironrust eaten as in earth’s mighty bosom a thousand of winters there they had rested the hoard was under a magic spell that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded gold of the ancients that earlman not any the ringhall could touch save rulinggod only 103 110 soothking of vict’ries gave whom he wished to god alone could give access to it 6he is earthfolk’s protector to open the treasure e’en to such among mortals as seemed to him proper 1 for ‘góda’ which seems a surprising epithet for a geat to apply to the “terrible” ongentheow b suggests ‘gomela’ the passage would then stand ‘the old one went then’ etc 2 for ‘segn higeláce’ k th and b propose ‘segn higeláces’ meaning higelac’s banner followed the swedes in pursuit—s suggests ‘sæcc higeláces’ and renders higelac’s pursuit—the hso reading as translated in our text means that the banner of the enemy was captured and brought to higelac as a trophy 3 the rendering given in this translation represents the king as being generous beyond the possibility of reproach but some authorities construe ‘him’ 2996 as plu and understand the passage to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received more reward than they were entitled to 4 the name ‘scyldingas’ here 3006 has caused much discussion and given rise to several theories the most important of which are as follows 1 after the downfall of hrothgar’s family beowulf was king of the danes or scyldings 2 for ‘scyldingas’ read ‘scylfingas’—that is after killing eadgils the scylfing prince beowulf conquered his land and held it in subjection 3 m considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053 cf hso 5 b takes ‘nihtes’ and ‘hwílum’ 3045 as separate adverbial cases and renders joy in the air had he of yore by night etc he thinks that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed 6 the parenthesis is by some emended so as to read 1 he ie god is the hope of men 2 he is the hope of heroes gr’s reading has no parenthesis but says … could touch unless god himself true king of victories gave to whom he would to open the treasure the secret place of enchanters etc the last is rejected on many grounds xlii wiglaf’s sad story—the hoard carried off then ’twas seen that the journey prospered him little who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden1 down ’neath the wall the warden erst slaughtered some few of the folktroop the feud then thereafter 5 was hotly avengèd ’tis a wonder where2 when the strengthfamous trooper has attained to the end of lifedays allotted then no longer the man may remain with his kinsmen where meadcups are flowing so to beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow 10 assaults he sought for himself had no knowledge how his leaving this life was likely to happen so to doomsday famous folkleaders down did call it with curses—who ’complished it there— 104 that that man should be ever of illdeeds convicted 15 confined in foulplaces fastened in hellbonds punished with plagues who this place should e’er ravage3 he cared not for gold rather the wielder’s favor preferred he first to get sight of4 wiglaf addresses his comrades wiglaf discoursed then wihstan his son 20 “oft many an earlman on one man’s account must sorrow endure as to us it hath happened the liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on kingdom’s keeper counsel to follow not to go to the guardian of the goldhoard but let him 25 lie where he long was live in his dwelling till the end of the world met we a destiny hard to endure the hoard has been looked at been gained very grimly too grievous the fate that5 the prince of the people pricked to come thither 30 i was therein and all of it looked at the building’s equipments since access was given me not kindly at all entrance permitted he tells them of beowulf’s last moments within under earthwall hastily seized i and held in my hands a hugeweighing burden 35 of hoardtreasures costly hither out bare them to my liegelord belovèd life was yet in him and consciousness also the old one discoursed then much and mournfully commanded to greet you beowulf’s dying request bade that remembering the deeds of your friendlord 40 ye build on the firehill of corpses a lofty burialbarrow broad and farfamous as ’mid worlddwelling warriors he was widely most honored while he reveled in riches let us rouse us and hasten 105 again to see and seek for the treasure 45 the wonder ’neath wall the way i will show you that close ye may look at ringgems sufficient and gold in abundance let the bier with promptness fully be fashioned when forth we shall come and lift we our lord then where long he shall tarry 50 wellbeloved warrior ’neath the wielder’s protection” wiglaf charges them to build a funeralpyre then the son of wihstan bade orders be given moodvaliant man to many of heroes holders of homesteads that they hither from far 6leaders of liegemen should look for the good one 55 with wood for his pyre “the flame shall now swallow the wan fire shall wax7 the warriors’ leader who the rain of the iron often abided when sturdily hurled the storm of the arrows leapt o’er lindenwall the lance rendered service 60 furnished with feathers followed the arrow” now the wisemooded son of wihstan did summon the best of the braves from the band of the ruler he takes seven thanes and enters the den seven together ’neath the enemy’s roof he went with the seven one of the heroes 65 who fared at the front a fireblazing torchlight bare in his hand no lot then decided who that hoard should havoc when heroearls saw it lying in the cavern uncaredfor entirely rusting to ruin they rued then but little 70 that they hastily hence hauled out the treasure they push the dragon over the wall the dearvalued jewels the dragon eke pushed they the worm o’er the wall let the wavecurrents take him 106 the waters enwind the ward of the treasures the hoard is laid on a wain there wounden gold on a wain was uploaded 75 a mass unmeasured the menleader off then the hero hoary to whale’sness was carried 1 for ‘gehýdde’ b suggests ‘gehýðde’ the passage would stand as above except the change of ‘hidden’ v 2 to ‘plundered’ the reference however would be to the thief not to the dragon 2 the passage ‘wundur … búan’ 30633066 m took to be a question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his appointed time had come—b sees a corruption and makes emendations introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or from old age but should find death in the performance of some deed of daring—s sees an indirect question introduced by ‘hwár’ and dependent upon ‘wundur’ a secret is it when the hero is to die etc—why may the two clauses not be parallel and the whole passage an old english cry of ‘how wonderful is death’—s’s is the best yet offered if ‘wundor’ means ‘mystery’ 3 for ‘strude’ in hso s suggests ‘stride’ this would require ‘ravage’ v 16 to be changed to ‘tread’ 4 ‘he cared … sight of’ 17 18 s emends so as to read as follows he beowulf had not before seen the favor of the avaricious possessor 5 b renders that which drew the king thither ie the treasure was granted us but in such a way that it overcomes us 6 ‘folcágende’ 3114 b takes as dat sing with ‘gódum’ and refers it to beowulf that is should bring firewood to the place where the good folkruler lay 7 c proposes to take ‘weaxan’ l ‘vescor’ and translate devour this gives a parallel to ‘fretan’ above the parenthesis would be discarded and the passage read now shall the fire consume the wanflame devour the prince of warriors etc xliii the burning of beowulf beowulf’s pyre the folk of the geatmen got him then ready a pile on the earth strong for the burning behung with helmets heroknights’ targets and brightshining burnies as he begged they should have them 5 then wailing warheroes their worldfamous chieftain their liegelord beloved laid in the middle the funeralflame soldiers began
